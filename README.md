# GolfScorecard
GolfScorecard Android app

Android project, expanded off of example project from Team Treehouse. This project is intended to be used as a personal scorecard either while golfing, or playing mini golf. The app will keep track of user's strokes, allow setting par values for each hole, and keep a score based on how far off the user is from the total par. 

Current:
- ListView with multiple button press options. 
- Live score updating on button presses, as well as refresh or closing of app (SharedPreferences data persistence).

Future:
- Multiple players to be added
- Mini golf ball color selection
- Allow user to change number of holes on course.
